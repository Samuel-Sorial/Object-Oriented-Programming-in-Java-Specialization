Coursera's link : https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming 

Here are my solutions for this specilaization. This Specialization is for aspiring software developers with some programming experience in at least one other programming language (e.g., Python, C, JavaScript, etc.) who want to be able to solve more complex problems through objected-oriented design with Java. In addition to learning Java, you will gain experience with two Java development environments (BlueJ and Eclipse), learn how to program with graphical user interfaces, and learn how to design programs capable of managing large amounts of data. These software engineering skills are broadly applicable across wide array of industries.

It consists of : 

Course 1 : Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software

Course 2 : Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data

Course 3 : Object Oriented Programming in Java

Course 4:  Data Structures and Performance
